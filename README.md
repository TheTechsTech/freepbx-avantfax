Josh North - josh.north@point808.com  
This started as a need for a module to link to the Ubuntu PIAF with Asterisk link.  I forked from FreepBX/helloworld as a jumping-off point.  It's probably a pretty crappy module but it is incredibly simple so do whatever you want with it, or if you find any major issues just send a pull request please so I can update this repo
